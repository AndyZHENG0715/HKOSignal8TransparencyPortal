Notes:
- All times are Hong Kong Time (HKT)
- Source: HKO Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals Database (official)
- 2025 marked first year since 1964 with two Signal 10 warnings
- Ragasa Signal 10 issued at record distance of 120 km, second-longest duration
- For Koinu and Saola, these are newly added typhoon events in this project so I didn't prepare. Please refer to `Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals｜Hong Kong Observatory(HKO)｜Warnings & Signals Database.pdf` for the official signal 8 and 10 timings.
