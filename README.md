# HKO Signal 8 Transparency Portal

A public-facing bilingual (English & Traditional Chinese) web portal that independently verifies Hong Kong Observatory's Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 issuance against actual observed wind data.

**Project Goal:** Compare official T8 signal issuance with real wind observations to classify each typhoon event into one of three tiers, measuring early-warning effectiveness and public safety impact.

---

## Overview

The Hong Kong Observatory issues Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 when sustained gale-force winds (≥63 km/h) are recorded across the reference network. This portal uses a **3-tier classification system** to evaluate whether each signal was issued responsibly—providing sufficient early warning for public preparation while avoiding unnecessary disruptions.

### Key Questions This Portal Answers

- **Was the T8 signal justified?** (Tier 1/2 = observed sustained gales; Tier 3 = unverified by wind data)
- **How much advance notice did people have?** (Early warning minutes between official issuance and actual gales)
- **What was the real-world impact?** (Casualties, property damage, and correlation with early-warning lead time)

---

## Data & Methodology

### Raw Data Source
- **Hong Kong Observatory 10-minute mean wind observations** from 8 reference anemometer stations across Hong Kong
- **Timeframe:** 2022–2025 (11 typhoon events)
- **Reference Network (HKO official):**
  - Cheung Chau (長洲)
  - Chek Lap Kok (赤鱲角)
  - Kai Tak (啟德)
  - Lau Fau Shan (流浮山)
  - Sai Kung (西貢)
  - Sha Tin (沙田)
  - Ta Kwu Ling (打鼓嶺)
  - Tsing Yi (青衣)

### 3-Tier Classification System

| Tier | Condition | Indicator |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Tier 1** | ≥4 stations ≥63 km/h for ≥3 consecutive 10-min intervals (~30 min) | 🟢 Sustained T8 Wind Speed Verified |
| **Tier 2** | Wind-lull-wind pattern (gales → drop → gales re-emerge) | ⚠️ Reappear T8 Wind Speed Verified |
| **Tier 3** | Neither Tier 1 persistence nor Tier 2 pattern detected | ❓ Unverified |
| **No Signal** | No official T8 issued | ➖ Not Applicable |

**Key Insight:** Tier 1 & 2 demonstrate that HKO's "expected to persist" criterion was met by observation data. Tier 3 signals require HKO to provide public explanation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+** (only standard library modules used)
- **Modern web browser** (ES6+ support, no IE11)
- **Static HTTP server** (for local preview)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd HKOSignal8TransparencyPortal
   ```

2. **Generate JSON data from raw CSVs** (if updating events)
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_event_data.py
   ```

3. **Preview the portal locally**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Python
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Option 2: Node
   npx serve
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   - Charts: `http://localhost:8000/prototypes/charts.html`

### Data Pipeline

```
Raw CSV Files (typhoon_data/EVENT/*.csv)
         ↓
   build_event_data.py (Python script)
         ↓
Generated JSON (data/index.json + data/events/*.json)
         ↓
   Web Portal & Charts
```

---

## Adding a New Typhoon Event

1. **Collect raw CSVs** from HKO and place them in a new folder under `typhoon_data/`
   - Folder naming convention: `<EventName>_<Date>` (e.g., `Nova_20251010`)
   - CSV format: `yyyymmdd-hhmm-latest_10min_wind.csv`

2. **Update metadata files:**
   - Add official T8/T10 signal timings to `typhoon_data/time_of_signal_8.md`
   - Add casualty & property loss data (if available) to `typhoon_data/casualty_and_lost_of_signal_8.md`

3. **Regenerate data**
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_event_data.py
   ```
   - Script auto-detects new event folder
   - Computes tiers deterministically
   - Outputs updated `data/index.json` and `data/events/<event>.json`

4. **Verify results** in the portal

## Portal Features (Planned/In Progress)

### Pages
- **Homepage** – Key metrics, event cards (tier-based colors), bilingual toggle
- **Event Detail** – Per-event timeline, station statistics, FAQ
- **Comparison Tool** – Multi-event analysis, side-by-side metrics
- **Methodology** – Tier definitions, HKO vs algorithm comparison, educational FAQs

### Charts
1. **Tier Compliance Pie** – Share of verified (Tier 1+2) vs unverified (Tier 3) signals
2. **Early Warning Lead/Lag Bar** – Minutes between official issuance and observed gales
3. **Casualty/Property Scatter** – Correlation between early warning and real-world impact
4. **Event Timeline Heatmap** – 10-min timeline × 8 stations, color-coded by wind speed
5. **Per-Event Interactive Timeline** – Station counts with T8 threshold reference line

### Design
- **Bilingual UI** (English & Traditional Chinese 繁體中文)
- **Mobile-first responsive** (breakpoint ~768px)
- **Accessible color palette** – Clear distinction between tier indicators
- **Interactive charts** – Chart.js 4.x, responsive, touch-friendly on mobile

---

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5/CSS3 + JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charts:** Chart.js 4.x (via CDN)
- **Data Format:** JSON (pre-generated, no backend API)
- **Data Processing:** Python 3.10+ (standard library only)
- **Deployment:** Static site (GitHub Pages compatible)
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers (no IE11)

---

## Bilingual Support

Translations use a centralized JSON dictionary (`i18n/`) with language-specific keys. Components toggle between English and Traditional Chinese via a language selector.

Example:
```html
<h2 data-key="timelineComparison">Timeline Comparison</h2>
```

Both keys are resolved at render time based on the active language context.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Display all 11 typhoon events with automated tier classification (no hardcoding)
✅ Calculate early warning time (Official start → Algorithm detection)
✅ Bilingual interface with seamless language toggle
✅ Interactive per-event timeline charts
✅ Multi-event comparison tool
✅ Tier-based visual distinction (colors, icons, borders)
✅ Reference network strictly adheres to 8 HKO stations
✅ Neutral educational framing (no subjective judgments)

---

## Key Design Principles

1. **Public-Facing:** No jargon—assumes audience has no meteorology background
2. **Neutral Tone:** Use "Tier 1/2/3" classification rather than "appropriate/inappropriate"
3. **Transparent:** Explain both benefits (early warning saves lives) and costs (unnecessary signals cause economic loss)
4. **Data-Driven:** All claims backed by actual HKO observation records
5. **Maintenance-Free:** Once CSV/metadata are updated, one script run regenerates all JSON
