## 📧 LegCo Panel Submission Letter

> Dear Panel Secretary,
>
> We are students from Hong Kong Baptist University (GCAP3226, Team 3). We kindly seek your assistance to circulate our report, "Typhoon Signal Analysis," to the relevant LegCo Panel. Our purpose is to share an independent, data‑driven review of Signal No. 8 timing and accuracy (2022–2025) and offer practical transparency suggestions that protect public safety while reducing unnecessary disruption. As students, we hope our work can contribute constructively to Members' evidence‑based oversight ahead of future typhoon seasons.
